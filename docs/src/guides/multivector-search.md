# Multivector Search with LanceDB Enterprise

A complete example for Multivector search is in this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/blob/main/examples/saas_examples/python_notebook/Multivector_on_LanceDB_Cloud.ipynb)

## Multivector Type

LanceDB natively supports multivector data types, enabling advanced search scenarios where 
a single data item is represented by multiple embeddings (e.g., using models like ColBERT 
or CoLPali). In this framework, documents and queries are encoded as collections of 
contextualized vectorsâ€”precomputed for documents and indexed for queries.

Key features:
- Indexing on multivector column: store and index multiple vectors per row.
- Supporint query being a single vector or multiple vectors
- Optimized search performance with [XTR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17788) with improved recall.

!!! info "Multivector Search Limitations"
    Currently, only the `cosine` metric is supported for multivector search. 
    The vector value type can be `float16`, `float32`, or `float64`.

## Using Multivector in Python

Currently, multivector search is only support in our Python SDK. 
Below is an example of using multivector search in LanceDB:

```python
import lancedb
import numpy as np
import pyarrow as pa

# Connect to LanceDB Cloud
db = lancedb.connect(
  uri="db://your-project-slug",
  api_key="your-api-key",
  region="your-cloud-region"
)

# Define schema with multivector field
schema = pa.schema(
    [
        pa.field("id", pa.int64()),
        # float16, float32, and float64 are supported
        pa.field("vector", pa.list_(pa.list_(pa.float32(), 256))),
    ]
)

# Create data with multiple vectors per document
data = [
    {
        "id": i,
        "vector": np.random.random(size=(2, 256)).tolist(),  # Each document has 2 vectors
    }
    for i in range(1024)
]

# Create table
tbl = db.create_table("multivector_example", data=data, schema=schema)

# Create index - only cosine similarity is supported for multi-vectors
tbl.create_index(metric="cosine", vector_column_name="vector")

# Query with a single vector
query = np.random.random(256)
results_single = tbl.search(query).limit(5).to_pandas()

# Query with multiple vectors
query_multi = np.random.random(size=(2, 256))
results_multi = tbl.search(query_multi).limit(5).to_pandas()
