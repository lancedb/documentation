!!! note "Welcome to LanceDB documentation!"
    This guide will help you navigate through our documentation based on your needs and experience level.

## **Finding What You Need**

The documentation is organized by topic and complexity level. Use the search function to find specific information, or browse through the sections to discover related topics. Each page includes links to related content, making it easy to explore connected concepts.

If you can't find what you're looking for, check the [**Changelog for latest updates**](../changelog/index.md) or [**GitHub to report Issues**](https://github.com/lancedb/documentation). The documentation is continuously updated to reflect new features and improvements in LanceDB.

Remember that the best way to learn is by doing. Start with [**Examples that match your use case**](../examples/index.md), then modify them to fit your specific needs. The documentation is designed to be both a reference and a learning resource. 

## **For New Users**

If you're new to LanceDB, start with the [**Quickstart guide**](../quickstart/index.md). It will walk you through installing LanceDB and show you how to create your first vector database. The guide includes simple examples that demonstrate basic operations like storing and retrieving vectors.

After the Quickstart, visit the [**Concepts section**](../concepts/data.md) to understand the fundamental ideas behind vector databases. This section explains what vectors are, how they're used in AI applications, and why LanceDB might be the right choice for your project.

## **For Developers**

Developers looking to integrate LanceDB into their applications should begin with the [**language-specific SDK guides**](../guides/tables/index.md). If you're using Python, head to the Python section where you'll find detailed API documentation and practical examples. JavaScript and TypeScript developers can find similar resources in the JS section.

The [**Examples section**](../examples/index.md) contains real-world use cases and implementation patterns. Each example is a complete, working solution that you can use as a starting point for your own projects. The code is thoroughly tested and includes comments explaining key concepts.

## **For System Architects**

If you're designing a system that uses LanceDB, the Guides section offers in-depth tutorials on architecture patterns and best practices. You'll learn about scaling considerations, performance optimization, and how to integrate LanceDB with other components in your system.

The Integrations section shows how LanceDB works with popular frameworks and tools. Whether you're using a specific AI framework or need to connect to existing infrastructure, you'll find detailed instructions here.

## **For Contributors**

Contributors to LanceDB should start with the API Reference section to understand the codebase. The documentation includes both high-level overviews and detailed technical specifications. Each API endpoint and function is documented with examples and usage notes.

When adding new features or fixing bugs, the test directories contain example code that demonstrates correct usage. These examples serve as both documentation and test cases, ensuring that the documentation stays accurate and up-to-date.
