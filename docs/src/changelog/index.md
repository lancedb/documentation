# **LanceDB Changelog**

## April 2025

Enhanced Performance and Improved Version Control

### Features
* **Reduced Commit Conflicts**: Mitigated upsert-induced table conflicts through client/server-side retry mechanisms.
* **New SDK APIs**:
    * `table.tags.create/list/update/delete/checkout`: Enables semantic versioning through intuitive tagging instead of numeric versioning
    * `wait_for_index`: Ensures complete data indexing with configurable `wait_timeout`.
* **Performance Improvements**:
    * **Query Latency**: Eliminated full cache ring scans when nodes < replication factor.
    * **Full-Text Search**: Introduced configurable FTS index prewarming to accelerate search operations. `enterprise`
    * **Table Creation**: Leveraged cached database connections to reduce overhead—ideal for bulk table creation scenarios.
* **Session-Level Object Store Caching**: Shared connection pools via weak references to object stores. Example: 100 tables → 1 S3 connection pool.
* **IVF_PQ float64 support**: Expanded vector indexing to float64 datasets (previously limited to float16/32).
* **Full-text search on string arrays**: Extended full-text search to support string array columns for efficient multi-value keyword search.
* **UI - Enhanced Table Preview**:
    * One-click vector copying from cells
    * Full row expansion on click (no truncation)
    * Consistent right-panel binary data display
* **UI - Direct Page Navigation**: Added page selector for instant access to specific data pages in table preview.

### Bug Fixes
* **Query Performance**:
    * Fixed hybrid search distance range filtering to properly respect lower and upper bounds. [\[lancedb#2356\]](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/pull/2356)
    * Enforced valid `k` parameters to prevent overflow. [\[lancedb#2354\]](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/pull/2354)
    * `BETWEEN clause`: Improved BETWEEN query handling to return 0 results when `start` > `end` instead of panicking. [\[lance#3706\]](https://github.com/lancedb/lance/pull/3706)
* **SDK/API Fixes**:
    * Fixed TypeScript SDK support for FTS advanced features (fuzzy search and boosting). [\[lancedb#2314\]](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/pull/2314)
    * Added scalar index support for small FixedSizeBinary columns (e.g., UUID). [\[lancedb#2297\]](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/pull/2297)
* **Index**:
    * Fixed IVF_PQ index on vector columns with NaN/INFs. [\[lance#3648\]](https://github.com/lancedb/lance/pull/3648)
    * Resolved GPU-based indexing crashes on non-contiguous arrays. [\[lance#3675\]](https://github.com/lancedb/lance/pull/3675) `enterprise`
    * Fixed B-tree index corruption during null remapping. [\[lance#3704\]](https://github.com/lancedb/lance/pull/3704)
* **Cloud Dashboard**: Optimized chart rendering for better visibility in the Cloud usage dashboard.

## March 2025

Enhanced Full-Text Search and Advanced Query Debugging Features

### Features
* **Enhanced Full-Text Search (FTS): Fuzzy Search & Boosting Now Available**: it improves user experience with resilient, typo-tolerant searches and can surface the most contextually relevant results faster.
* **New SDK APIs**: 
    * `explain_plan`: Diagnose query performance and debug unexpected results by inspecting the execution plan.
    * `analyze_plan`: Analyze query execution metrics to optimize performance and resource usage. Such metrics include execution time, number of rows processed, I/O stats, and more.
    * `restore`: Revert to a specific prior version of your dataset and modify it from a verified, stable state.
* **Scalar Indexing for Extended Data Types**: LanceDB now supports scalar indexing on UUID columns of FixedSizeBinary type.
* **Binary vector support in TypeScript SDK**: LanceDB's TypeScript SDK now natively supports binary vector indexing and querying with production-grade efficiency.
* **Support S3-compatible object store**: Extended LanceDB Enterprise deployment to work with S3-compatible object stores, such as Tigris, Minio and etc. `enterprise`

### Bug Fixes
* **Improved Merge insert performance**: Enhanced the merge-insert operation to reduce error rates during upsert operations, improving data reliability.[\[lance#3603\]](https://github.com/lancedb/lance/pull/3603).
* **Batch Ingestion Error**: Updated error codes for batch ingestion failures from 500 to 409 to accurately reflect resource conflict scenarios.
* **Cloud Signup Workflow Fix**: Resolved an issue where users encountered a blank page after organization creation during the Cloud signup process.
* **Table Preview Data Display Issue**: Fixed a bug causing the table preview page to show a generic "Something went wrong" error for datasets containing `datetime` columns, which previously prevented data inspection.
* **Rate Limit Error Clarity**: Added explicit error messaging for system rate limits (e.g., API keys per table), replacing vague notifications that confused users.

## February 2025

Multivector Search ready and Table data preview available in Cloud UI

### Features
* **Multivector Search is now live**: documents can be stored as contextualized vector lists. Fast multi-vector queries are supported at scale, powered by our XTR optimization.
* **`Drop_index` added to SDK**: users can remove unused or outdated indexes from your tables.
* **Explore Your Data at a Glance**: preview sample data from any table with a single click. `lancedb-cloud`
* **Search by Project/Table in Cloud UI**: allow users to quickly locate the desired project/table. `lancedb-cloud`

### Bug Fixes
* **FTS stability fix**: Resolved a crash in Full Text Search (FTS) during flat-mode searches.
* **`prefilter` parameter enforcement**: Fixed a bug where the prefilter parameter was not honored in FTS queries.
* **Vector index bounds error**: Addressed an out-of-bounds indexing issue during vector index creation.
* **`distance_range()` compatibility**: Fixed errors when performing vector searches with `distance_range()` on unindexed rows.
* **Error messaging improvements**: Replaced generic HTTP 500 errors with detailed, actionable error messages for easier debugging.

## January 2025

Support Hamming Distance and GPU based indexing ready

### Features
* **Support Hamming distance and binary vector**: Added `hamming` as a distance metric (joining `l2`, `cosine`, `dot`) for binary vector similarity search.
* **GPU-Accelerated IVF-PQ indexing**: Build IVF-PQ indexes 10x faster. `enterprise`
* **AWS Graviton 4 & Google Axion build optimizations**: ARM64 SIMD acceleration cuts query costs. `enterprise`

* **Self-Serve Cloud Onboarding**: new workflow-based UI guides users for smooth experience. `lancedb-cloud`

### Bug Fixes
* `list_indices` and `index_stats` now always fetch the latest version of the table by default unless a specific version is explicitly provided.
* **Error message fix**: Improved clarity for cases where `create_index` is called to create a vector index on tables with fewer than 256 rows.
* **TypeScript SDK fixes**: Resolved an issue where `createTable()` failed to correctly save embeddings and for `mergeInsert` not utilizing saved embeddings. [lancedb#2065](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/pull/2065)

* **Azure Stack Router Deployment**: route traffic efficiently to serve low query latency. `enterprise`
* **Distance range filtering**: filter query results using `distance_range()` to return search results with a lowerbound, upperbound or a range [\[lance#3326\]](https://github.com/lancedb/lance/pull/3326).
