# **What is LanceDB Enterprise?**

**LanceDB Enterprise** is both a **private cloud or a BYOC solution** that transforms your data lake into a high-performance vector database that can operate at extreme scale.

With a vector database built for lakehouse architecture, you can serve millions of tables and tens of billions of rows in a single index, improve retrieval quality using hybrid search with blazing-fast metadata filters, and reduce costs by up to 200x with object storage.

For private deployments, high performance at extreme scale, or if you have strict security requirements, [talk to us about LanceDB Enterprise](mailto:contact@lancedb.com).

## Benefits

- **Performance**: Tens of thousands of QPS with latency in single-digit milliseconds,
  hundreds of thousands of rows per second write throughput, and low-latency indexing across many tables.
- **Scalability**: Support workloads requiring data isolation with millions of active tables, or
  a single table with billions of rows.
- **Truly Multimodal**: Storage of the actual data itself, alongside the embeddings and metadata, to
  enable lightning-fast retrieval and filtering.
- **Effortless Migration**: Migrate from Open Source LanceDB to LanceDB Enterprise
  by simply using a connection URL.
- **Multi-cloud**: Available on AWS, GCP, and Azure. Open data layer that eliminates vendor lock-in.
- **Security**: Encryption at rest, SOC 2 Type II, and HIPAA compliance.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Bring your own cloud, account, region, or Kubernetes cluster, or let LanceDB manage it for you.
- **Observability**: First-class integration with existing observability systems for logging, monitoring, and distributed traces using OpenTelemetry.
