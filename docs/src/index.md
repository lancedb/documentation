[**LanceDB is an open-source multimodal database**](overview/index.md) designed for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of vectors and multimodal data. Use our documentation to build a production-grade service with a simple API for inserting, querying, and filtering vectors. 

LanceDB is ideal for **semantic search**, **recommendation systems**, and **Generative AI applications**.
