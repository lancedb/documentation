[**LanceDB is an open-source vector database**](overview.md) designed for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of vectors and multimodal data. Use our documentation to build a production-grade service with a simple API for inserting, querying, and filtering vectors. 

LanceDB is ideal for **semantic search**, **recommendation systems**, and **Generative AI applications**. 

## **Product Release: Announcing LanceDB Cloud!**

1. [**LanceDB Cloud:**](quickstart-cloud.md) Create a LanceDB Cloud cluster that's completely serverless. Your application simply connects over HTTP/HTTPS, and LanceDB handles scaling, storage, and indexing for you. 
2. [**LanceDB OSS:**](basic.md) If self-hosting, embed LanceDB directly into your backend, whether thatâ€™s a Django, Flask, FastAPI, or Node.js service. Check out our available [client libraries](api/index.md).
3. [**LanceDB Enterprise:**](enterprise/index.md) Build the best private environment that suits your needs. Manage your own clusters via our [Dashboard UI](https://accounts.lancedb.com/sign-up), but continue to run them within your own private infrastructure for complete security and sovereignty.
